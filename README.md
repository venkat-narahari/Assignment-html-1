# HTML Course Assignment 1

This project contains a simple website showcasing personal interests and favorite quotes.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file containing the website's structure and content.

- `style.css`: This CSS file provides styling to the HTML elements, defining the layout, fonts, and colors.

### HTML Structure

    - Main heading `<h1>`.
    - Introductory paragraph `<p>`.
    - Unordered list of interests `ul`.
    - Section for favorite quotes `<h2>`.

### CSS Styling

    - The body has a coloured background and a font family.
    - The main content is centered within a wide container.
    - Quotes are displayed in centered blocks with borders.

## Viewing the Website:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Ensure the `styles.css` file is in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Additional Notes:

- The website is a basic structure, ready for further content and styling.
- Consider adding more sections, images, or interactive elements to enhance the website's functionality.
