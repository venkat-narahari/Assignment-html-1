# HTML Course Assignment 1

This project contains a simple website showcasing personal interests and favorite quotes.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the website.

- `style.css`: This CSS file provides styling to the HTML elements, defining the layout, fonts, and colors.

### HTML Structure

The website consists of a 
    - main heading (h1), an introductory paragraph (p)
    - a unordered list of interests (ul)
    - a section for favorite quotes (h2, blockquote)

### CSS Styling

    - The body has a coloured background and a font family.
    - The main content is centered within a wide container.
    - Quotes are displayed in centered blocks with borders.

## Viewing the Website:

1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Ensure the styles.css file is in the same directory as index.html.

## Additional Notes:

- The website is currently a basic structure, ready for further content and styling.
- Consider adding more sections, images, or interactive elements to enhance the website's functionality.
